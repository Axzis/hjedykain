## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a very low saturation near-analog of soft teal, to ensure good contrast and readability.
- Accent color: Muted Gold (#B4A774), another near-analog color to add a touch of understated luxury and highlight key actions without overpowering the design.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a serif with a fashionable, high-end feel. Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif suitable for longer blocks of text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for navigation and actions.
- Clean and modern layout with intuitive grouping of information. Responsive design to adapt to various screen sizes.
- Subtle animations for UI feedback (e.g., button hover effects, loading indicators).
